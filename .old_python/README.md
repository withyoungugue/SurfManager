## 💡 The Story Behind SurfManager

**The Problem**
Modern developers often work with multiple accounts, different projects, and various configurations. But managing session data for apps like VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf can be tedious:

- Manual backup-restore is time-consuming and error-prone
- Switching between accounts requires repeated logout-login cycles
- Experimenting with settings risks breaking perfectly tuned configurations
- Authentication data often conflicts when not handled properly

**The Solution**
SurfManager was born from personal developer frustration needing an elegant solution to this problem. What started as a simple script for backing up VS Code settings evolved into a comprehensive session manager that:

- **Automates repetitive tasks** - No more manual backup-restore
- **Prevents data loss** - Smart app close and auto-backup protection
- **Streamlines workflow** - Switch profiles in seconds, not minutes
- **Handles edge cases** - File locks, process conflicts, permission issues

**The Evolution**
From a simple CLI script to a full-featured GUI application with:
- Advanced process management (ProcessKiller)
- Real-time progress tracking
- Filesystem-based storage (reliable)
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Developer-friendly UX

## 📖 How to Use SurfManager

### 🎯 Getting Started

#### Main Use Case: Multiple Account Management

**Step 1: Setup First Account**
1. **Login to your IDE** - Use your first account in VS Code/Cursor/etc.
2. **Configure your workspace** - Install extensions, set preferences, login to services
3. **Create backup** - In SurfManager, click an app → enter session name (e.g., "work-account")
4. **Done!** Your complete session is saved

**Step 2: Add More Accounts**
1. **Reset the app** - Use SurfManager's Reset Data tab to clear current session
2. **Login with new account** - Use different credentials in your IDE
3. **Configure new environment** - Set up workspace for this account
4. **Save new session** - Create another backup (e.g., "personal-account")

**Step 3: Switch Between Accounts**
1. **Browse sessions** - View all saved sessions in the Sessions tab
2. **Double-click to restore** - Or right-click → "Load"
3. **Launch your IDE** - You're logged in with that account! 🎉

### 🖱️ Interface Guide

**Sessions Tab:**
- **App buttons** - Click to create new backup
- **Sessions table** - View all saved sessions
- **Right-click menu** - Quick actions (Load, Update, Set Active, Rename, Browse, Delete)
- **Auto-Backups toggle** - Switch between manual sessions and auto-backups
- **Search bar** - Filter sessions by name

**Reset Data Tab:**
- **Reset button** - Clear app data (with auto-backup option)
- **AutoBackup toggle** - Enable/disable automatic backup before reset
- **Launch button** - Open app folder or executable

### 💡 Tips & Tricks

- **Right-click sessions** for quick actions menu
- **Double-click sessions** to restore instantly
- **Toggle Auto-Backups** to view automatic backups separately
- **Use descriptive names** like "work-main", "personal-dev", etc.
- **Enable AutoBackup** before reset operations for safety

## ⚠️ Limitations

### 🔒 Platform-Specific Restrictions

**Windows User Isolation**
Sessions are tied to the Windows user account that created them. You cannot transfer backups between different Windows users.

**Why this exists:**
- Windows encrypts app credentials with user-specific keys
- Authentication tokens (like DIPS files) are encrypted per Windows user
- Cross-user session restoration would fail authentication

**What this means:**
- ✅ Switch between accounts **on the same Windows user**
- ❌ Copy backups to another Windows user account
- ✅ Each Windows user must create their own session backups
